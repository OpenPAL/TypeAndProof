## Type and proof

This is the latex source of Type and proof, a short article about logic, type system, lambda calculus, and curry howard isomorphism.

There may be some mistakes and it is not completed yet. Issues and pull requests are welcomed! 

**TODO** 

- denotational semantic of UTLC and STLC
- C-H isomorphism under sequent calculus
- type inference of STLC 
- type checking VS. proof checking 
- \beta and \eta reduction VS. prooving 
- cut elimination and it's role in C-H isomorphism 
- intro to proof search 
- intro to category theory
- algebra semantic of logic and STLC
- intro to lambda cube
- linear logic and lienar type 
- substructural logic and substructural type
- focusing/polarizing in type theory  
- First order logic
- basic model theory

## How to publish the PDF

https://openpal.github.io/TypeAndProof/ is where we publish. Here are several steps:

1. Generate the PDF file from source
2. Clone another copy of this repo, named like `TypeAndProof-www`
3. In that new repo, check out into the `gh-pages` branch
4. Copy the new version of PDF here
5. `git add --all; git commit -m "Update PDF"`
6. Make a PR or something to that particular branch
